# MRCC compile script for Windows #
This is a compile script that I wrote for the program MRCC (www.mrcc.hu/) to serve as a replacement of the default shell script that is used to compile the program on POSIX systems.

To compile, you need to access the source code from www.mrcc.hu and change some of the source files (as mentioned [here](https://mrcc.hu/index.php/forum/users-corner/250-native-compile-of-mrcc-on-windows) )

The command line options and instructions for running are in the script (open with notepad).

To run the script on Windowsâ€”

From Powershell: `.\compile.ps1 <options>`

From command prompt: `powershell .\compile.ps1 <options>`
  
If execution is disallowed by policy, then try from command prompt: `powershell -ExecutionPolicy bypass .\compile.ps1 <options>`

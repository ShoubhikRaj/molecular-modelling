# MRCC compile script for Windows #
This is a compile script that I wrote for the program MRCC (www.mrcc.hu/) to serve as a replacement of the default shell script that is used to compile the program on POSIX systems.

The command line options and instructions for running are in the script (open with notepad).
To compile, you need to access the source code from www.mrcc.hu and change some of the source files (as mentioned [here](https://mrcc.hu/index.php/forum/users-corner/250-native-compile-of-mrcc-on-windows)
